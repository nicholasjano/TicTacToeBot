# TicTacToeGame
This is a Tic Tac Toe bot, where you can verse it either starting or going second.
The bot is trained by an algorith I created. With perfect play from the user, every game will end up in a draw.
The bot will convert any winning position. If you need help, there is a help button that shows your next best move.
The game is downloaded pre-trained, but if you'd like to retrain it yourself, empty the simulations.txt file and train.
